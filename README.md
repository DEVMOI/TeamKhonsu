Hello,

This project was started to help our Community know when Member's of our Stream Team are active and online.

Currently the Meat and Potatoes of our Site consists of a Twitch Status viewer in the form of cards populated with the Users Twitch Name, a Snap Shot of the current game they're playing, the name of the game. Soon we will be adding a way to view and chat with your favorite Streamer directly from the site.

The page was built using the Bootstrap Framework, some custom CSS and JS/JQuery using the Twitch API to provide the generated cards with our Team's Current Twitch Info and give the buttons that filter them out a little life.

Please check with us @TeamKhonsu or the site for future updates.

Thank you for viewing Team Khonsu's Github Repo!
